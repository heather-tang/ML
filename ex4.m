% NNCOSTFUNCTION Implements the neural network cost function for a two layer
% neural network which performs classification
%   [J grad] = NNCOSTFUNCTON(nn_params, hidden_layer_size, num_labels, ...
%   X, y, lambda) computes the cost and gradient of the neural network. The
%   parameters for the neural network are "unrolled" into the vector
%   nn_params and need to be converted back into the weight matrices. 
% 
%   The returned parameter grad should be a "unrolled" vector of the
%   partial derivatives of the neural network.
%

% Reshape nn_params back into the parameters Theta1 and Theta2, the weight matrices
% for our 2 layer neural network
Theta1 = reshape(nn_params(1:hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1)), ...
                 hidden_layer_size, (input_layer_size + 1));

Theta2 = reshape(nn_params((1 + (hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1))):end), ...
                 num_labels, (hidden_layer_size + 1));

% Setup some useful variables
m = size(X, 1);
         
% You need to return the following variables correctly 
J = 0;
Theta1_grad = zeros(size(Theta1));
Theta2_grad = zeros(size(Theta2));

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: You should complete the code by working through the
%               following parts.
%
% Part 1: Feedforward the neural network and return the cost in the
%         variable J. After implementing Part 1, you can verify that your
%         cost function computation is correct by verifying the cost
%         computed in ex4.m
%
% Part 2: Implement the backpropagation algorithm to compute the gradients
%         Theta1_grad and Theta2_grad. You should return the partial derivatives of
%         the cost function with respect to Theta1 and Theta2 in Theta1_grad and
%         Theta2_grad, respectively. After implementing Part 2, you can check
%         that your implementation is correct by running checkNNGradients
%
%         Note: The vector y passed into the function is a vector of labels
%               containing values from 1..K. You need to map this vector into a 
%               binary vector of 1's and 0's to be used with the neural network
%               cost function.
%
%         Hint: We recommend implementing backpropagation using a for-loop
%               over the training examples if you are implementing it for the 
%               first time.
%
% Part 3: Implement regularization with the cost function and gradients.
%
%         Hint: You can implement this around the code for
%               backpropagation. That is, you can compute the gradients for
%               the regularization separately and then add them to Theta1_grad
%               and Theta2_grad from Part 2.

% Part 1 (Forward Propagation + write code for cost function with regularization)
X = [ones(m,1) X];
a1 = X';
a2 = sigmoid(Theta1 * a1);
a2 = [ones(1,m); a2];
a3 = sigmoid(Theta2 * a2);

Y = zeros(num_labels, m);


% Part 2 (Back Propagation + accumulating errors)
for i = 1:m
    row = y(i);
    Y(row, i) = 1;
end

J = -1/m * sum(sum(Y .* log(a3) + (1-Y) .* log(1-a3)));
% J = 1/m * sum(sum( -Y .* log(a3) - (1-Y) .* log(1 - a3))) ;


%Part 3( Add regularization values to gradients)

Theta1_grad(:,1:1) = 1/m * Theta1_grad(:,1:1);
Theta2_grad(:,1:1) = 1/m * Theta2_grad(:,1:1);

Theta1_grad(:,2:end) = 1/m * ( Theta1_grad(:,2:end) + lambda * Theta1(:,2:end) ) ;
Theta2_grad(:,2:end) = 1/m * ( Theta2_grad(:,2:end) + lambda * Theta2(:,2:end) ) ;

function g = sigmoidGradient(z)
%SIGMOIDGRADIENT returns the gradient of the sigmoid function
%evaluated at z
% g = SIGMOIDGRADIENT(z) computes the gradient of the sigmoid function
% evaluated at z. This should work regardless if z is a matrix or a
% vector. In particular, if z is a vector or matrix, you should return
% the gradient for each element.
